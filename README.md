# My CRUD Project

I started this project to enhance my skills with the Spring Framework and to gain hands-on experience with key technologies commonly used in modern Java back-end development.

## This project makes use of the following technologies:

- **H2 Database** : An in-memory relational database used for development and testing

- **Bean Validation** : Used to enforce constraints on input data, ensuring that values meet specific criteria before being processed or persisted.

- **JPA with Hibernate** : Java Persistence API (JPA) is used for object-relational mapping (ORM), and Hibernate is the JPA implementation in this project.

- **Rest - API** : The application exposes a REST API, allowing external systems to interact with it over HTTP using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

## What the project does

The core functionality of the project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) back-end system implemented using Spring Boot and Rest - API principles. This allows a front-end application to send HTTP requests and receive responses accordingly.

During development and testing, I used **Postman** to manually send HTTP requests to the API and verify that it was behaving correctly.
